Abstract:

Transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) channels play a role
in several inflammatory and nociceptive processes. Previous work
showed that magnetic electrical field-induced antinociceptive
[corrected] action is mediated by activation of capsaicin-sensitive
sensory afferents. In this study, a modified Hodgkin-Huxley model, in
which TRP-like current (ITRP) was incorporated, was implemented to
predict the firing behavior of action potentials (APs), as the model
neuron was exposed to sinusoidal changes in externally-applied
voltage. When model neuron is exposed to low-frequency sinusoidal
voltage, increased maximal conductance of ITRP can enhance repetitive
bursts of APs accompanied by a shortening of inter-spike interval
(ISI) in AP firing. The change in ISIs with number of interval is
periodic with the phase-locking. In addition, increased maximal
conductance of ITRP can abolish chaotic pattern of AP firing in model
neuron during exposure to high-frequency voltage.  The ISI pattern is
converted from irregular to constant, as maximal conductance of ITRP
is increased under such high-frequency voltage. Our simulation results
suggest that modulation of TRP-like channels functionally expressed in
small-diameter peripheral sensory neurons should be an important
mechanism through which it can contribute to the firing pattern of
APs.
